# Project Title: Logical Puzzles Solver Using Symbolic Logic

## Description
This project involves creating a solver for a series of logical puzzles using symbolic logic and model checking. The puzzles involve characters who can either be knights (who always tell the truth) or knaves (who always lie). By defining logical statements for each puzzle and using a symbolic logic framework, the program determines the status of each character (knight or knave) based on their statements.

## What I Learned
- **Symbolic Logic:**
  - Gained a deep understanding of symbolic logic and how to represent logical statements and implications in code.
- **Model Checking:**
  - Learned how to implement model checking to evaluate logical expressions and determine the validity of different models.
- **Problem-Solving:**
  - Enhanced problem-solving skills by translating complex logical puzzles into formal logic representations.
- **Python Programming:**
  - Improved Python programming skills, including the use of logical operators, control structures, and functions.
- **Debugging:**
  - Developed debugging techniques to troubleshoot logical errors in the representation and evaluation of logic statements.
